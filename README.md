# FoodTruck
Testing Java with Spring, and Async

The main reason for this repository is to keep practicing and experimenting with apis,
rxjava, architecture, and all the stuff to improve.
Also, saving the knowledge acquired within the year in my current work as a software developer junior.

As for now, just a few endpoints with it:
> since it is working only in local, all urls work only with localhost
> I will keep the name "FoodTruck", because it is the main reason on this repository, to recreate food oriented project, with payment, users, online menu, etc.
